Transcribe or translate your media files into .SRT subtitles using AI.

## Installation:
1. [Click here](https://github.com/ChaitanyaKumarS2403/CapIT/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the .zip file.
2. Head to your downloaded path, Right-click on `CapIT - main` and click on `Extract Here`.
3. Open the unzipped `CapIT - main` and double click on the file `CapIT - Launcher.bat`.

The launcher will look up for the dependencies in your system, and will install for you, if any of the requirements are missing.

## Setup:
1. After the python is installed on your system, you are required to relaunch the application `CapIT - Launcher.bat`.
2. Once the application starts, you need to head to the `Settings` tab, and install the engines from the buttom of the window. (Remember not to close the Terminal Window in the background – Keep it running while application is in use.)
3. After the engines are installed, check the status of the engines from the left bottom corner of the application. (Sometimes, the status might not be reflected immediately. Please relaunch the application and confirm if unclear.)
4. Once the engines are set ready, install the model of choice to process the caption generations. The quality of the captions are presented based on hierarchy – [(Large : Highest Quality), (Tiny : Least Quality)].
5. Note that, better the model, higher is the time taken to process. Processing ETA also depends upon the file size / length of the media selected. Hence, please wait while the application generates the captions for you!
6. Once the model is installed and activated from the settings, go to `Home` tab, and enter the path (or) simply browse for the media file you want to generate captions for, and hit select.
7. Check if required model is activated from above, and choose between `Translate` or `Transcribe`.
8. - Use Translate if you want to generate captions in English for any language media.
   - Use Transcribe if you want to generate captions in the detected regional language. (Most likely inaccurate - higher bugs/glitches)
9. Once the configurations are done, hit `Start` and the processing starts.
10. You will be alerted with a alert box upon finishing the task, check the path same as the location of the media file selected.
11. You will find the generated .SRT file in the same location with the same file name.
